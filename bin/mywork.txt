Part 1

The adjustment is done in Windows10. I don't have mac and I tried to set up the environment on ASW and virtual machine, but there are too many prerequisites on both of them.

As for the previous code,it seems that no matter what clusters numbers is set in the console, it is always 10, so I changed the code.

I finished the VLAD part. I have some difficulty in understanding the ADC/PCA, so I didn't go on. But, in my understanding, this step is to decrease the dimensions, thus to improve the efficiency, while balancing the accuracy. And finally, similiar images will have similiar VLAD features, thus are identified.

Also, I visualisation the VLAD in "visualisation.py"


Part 2
Finished the whole processing show in the paper.
Usage: 1) train 2) vlad 3) rdcidx 4) query_vlad

Since I change the vlad.pickle structure, the "visualisation.py" doesn't work for now.

Need to delete the data, e.g. the .mdb file under "pq.idx/", bofore start.
